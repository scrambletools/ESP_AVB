# AVB Talker and Listener Component

This component provides a basic implementation of an AVB talker and listener.

For a demo on how to use it, see the example on Github (scrambletools/ESP-AVB-Example).

Current features:

- 1 Talker
- 1 Listener
- run talker and listener simultaneously
- up to 2 channels per stream
- AAF PCM audio
- 24 bit audio
- 48 kHz sample rate

Tested with:

- ESP32-P4 and ES8311 codec
- Waveshare ESP32-P4-ETH board
- MOTU AVB switch
- Apple Mac Mini M1 and M4
- Sonnet Thunderbolt AVB Adapter
- Hive AVB Controller

ATDECC support:

Note that ATDECC support is limited to functionality that is required for an AVB talker and listener. No effort has been made to implement functionality that is needed to operate as a controller.
